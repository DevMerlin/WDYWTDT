        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This slot machine / magic eight-ball like toy really started out as a joke, once I knew the domains related were avaliable. In that effect, it's slightly based off the 
		old advertising campaign - but completely unrelated. Somehow or other, it actually became a real thing after the conversation about the possibilities ended. I'm not entirelly
		sure why. </p>
		
		<p>What Do You Want to Do Today? was build using Phaser.io and HTML5, Canvas tech in roughly a week and three versions. That it is published is not the end of the develpment,
		however. There is still a lot to do - it just means that it is actually at a state where it is playable. This is the roadmap I'm currently looking at:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Add a Weather Icon - Open the Gate To view your local weather</li>
			<li>A lot more random phrases</li>
			<li>Add falling coins and collectables - random bits.</li>
			<li>Eventually add additional features to allow the slot machine to be randomized</li>
			<li>Create fully custom icons</li>
		<ul>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>The icons that WDYWTDT uses come from <a href="Iconfinder.com">Iconfinder.com</a>, while the remainder of the art is custom. It is likely that at a future stage, they will be replaced with fully unique icons,
		as is outlined in the roadmap.</p>
		
		<p>The sound effects are a combination of bought and generated - such as the background reel effect, while the music is produced by <a href="https://incompetech.com/music/">Kevin Macleod</a> and clipped to fit slot machine "win" tunes.
		</p>
